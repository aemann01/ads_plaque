# Trinity

Because of the size of this dataset denovo assembly will take considerable computational resources. For this I ran trinity on a cluster using 80 threads and 1500GB of memory. Attached PBS script has full trinity command. To replicate this analysis you will need to have trinity v.2.11.0 installed either locally or on your institution's cluster.
